	// This is a simple Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
	// It serves as a starting point for building a command-line application.
	// You can add more functionality and features as needed.
	// For example, you can use the "flag" package to parse command-line arguments,
	// or use the "os" package to interact with the file system.
	// Happy coding!
